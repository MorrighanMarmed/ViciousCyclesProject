          <p>At Vicious Cycles, we understand the drive to excel, the need to challenge yourself, and the determination to get back up and keep going. 
              If you have the passion we'll provide the solution. We are a group of passionate mountain bikers. We love the sport and we love to race. When we aren't racing, 
              we are either out on the trails or at the bike shop.</p>

            <p>Owners Nick and Bill have been lifelong friends who love mountain bike racing and have competed in multiple USA Cycling Mountain Bike National Championship 
                competitions. This competitive nature and enjoyment of the sport led to creating a business where they could share their enthusiasm and help others find theirs.</p>
<p>We believe that mountain biking is a lifestyle and not just a hobby. We want to share our passion with others by providing them with high-quality bikes and gear at an 
                affordable price. We are a passionate team of mountain bike enthusiasts who are always looking for ways to push the limits of our bikes and ourselves.</p>
            
            <p>Having been in the bike industry for more than 15 years, we have witnessed how it has grown from a niche market to an international phenomenon. We work with some 
                of the best brands in the industry and we are proud to be part of this exciting journey. We are not only passionate about mountain bikes but also about what 
                they represent: freedom, exploration, adventure, and a way to enjoy nature while staying fit.</p>
